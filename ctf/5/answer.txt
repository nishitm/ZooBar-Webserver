strtoul,conver the input in to usigned long.So if we pass negetive value to it follwed by a binary that gives a shell prompt, so with count <0 then the check is bypased -- if(count<maxpint),MAXPOINT being 777 identfied by reading make file.
We followed the same shell code injection into executable stack as we did in ex1 of project 1.
Also memcpy wroks fine as memcpy takes third argument as unsigned int,so negetive value becomes +ve.There were some hit and trails of identifying the correct value of count.
python file shellcode22.py contains input string. And shellcode.bin is taken from lab1 that prompts shell with user rights.
