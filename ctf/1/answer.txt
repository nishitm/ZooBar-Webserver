running $ gdb ./dew and executing in step by step execution mode, with info locals allows us to identify the variable in that file. Out of which one of the variable was 'command',which has value du -h flag.txt,after the file name is read.So we did changed the du to od(because od has option -h) by $ cp  /usr/bin/od ~/du.Then adding home to path.Then we got output in hex.Which we decoded using online hex to ascii converter.
