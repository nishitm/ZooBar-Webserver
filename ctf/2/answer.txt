In this exercise, after analyzing the code we came to know that key was time based. so we go to the directory of 2 and check ls -l to find out the date of the .enc doc. Then we generated the list of 120 keys by changing our system's date. After that we crate a lockit_decrypt.py file (which is included in this dir) and run with the generated keys. It will give 120 doc file in which we found the flag file.
